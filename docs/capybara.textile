h1. Chrome

Since Firefox comes with Websockets "disabled:"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebSockets", even though there's a way to enable it through:
  a. go to about:config
  b. set network.websocket.enabled to true
  c. set network.websocket.override-security-block to true.
  d. restart Firefox

But it's still easier to support Chrome by default.
In order to get it to work:
  a. download Chrome itself from "http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/":"http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/" (yes, it's Beta, but Selenium Webdriver only supports that version for now)
  b. download Chrome Driver from "http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list":"http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list"
  c. unzip your stuff anywhere and add that dir to your PATH

h2. Mac OS X warning

There is a bug in this initial version of the chromedriver where it explicitly checks for Chromium instead of Google Chrome.  To use it with Google Chrome:
  ln -s "/Applications/Google Chrome.app"/ \
      "/Applications/Chromium.app"
  ln -s "/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
      "/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium"
